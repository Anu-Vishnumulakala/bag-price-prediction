# bag-price-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the price of bags using machine learning techniques based on features such as brand, material, size, and other relevant attributes.
## Overview
- **Goal:** Use regression models to predict bag prices based on features like brand, material, size, and compartments.
- **Data Source:** Two datasets – one for training (`bag_train.csv`) and one for testing (`bag_student_test.csv`)
- **Python & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Best Models:** SVR & Ridge Regression (RMSE ≈ 38.90)
